## **Multi-Modal Classifier: Vision Transformer & Transformer Encoder Block**  

This repository provides a **lightweight multi-modal classification model** that seamlessly integrates **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for image feature extraction and a **Transformer Encoder Block** for text processing. By leveraging **self-attention mechanisms**, this model efficiently captures both spatial relationships in images and sequential dependencies in text.  

The extracted features from both modalities are **concatenated** and passed through a **fully connected classifier** to generate the final prediction. This architecture is designed to handle **multi-modal data** efficiently and can be used for tasks such as **image-text classification, multi-modal sentiment analysis, and document classification**.

---

## **How It Works**  

The multi-modal classification model follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Image Feature Extraction (ViT)**  
   - The **Vision Transformer (ViT)** is used to process images by dividing them into patches.
   - Each patch is **linearly embedded**, followed by **positional encoding**.
   - The sequence of patches is then passed through **self-attention layers** to extract meaningful features.

2. **Text Feature Extraction (Transformer Encoder Block)**  
   - The input text is tokenized and converted into embeddings.
   - A **Transformer Encoder Block** applies self-attention and layer normalization.
   - The processed text embeddings capture the semantic relationships between words.

3. **Feature Fusion & Classification**  
   - The **image and text features** are concatenated.
   - The concatenated representation is passed through a **classifier**.
   - The model outputs the **final class prediction**.
